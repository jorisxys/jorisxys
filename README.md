- ðŸ‘€ Looking at stackoverflow for an obscure but working solution to a bug.
- ðŸŒ± Expanding my skill tree with java, js, php, sql, html&css. Most importantly focusing on having a big/good Trunk (fundamentals) 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Through github or a future messaging/mail communication app programmed by yours truly.

just keeping the process of learning and struggling fun and enjoying all that makes up computer science and in part the world.
